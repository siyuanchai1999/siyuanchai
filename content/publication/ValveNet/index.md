abstract: "Mitral regurgitation flow is a critical diagnostic tool cardiological disease. We proposed a Convolutional Nerural Network approach to estimate regurgitation flow to replace manual force of calculation. The work involves denoising the doppler images, extracting speed info from labels, recognizing the aliasing region, and finally estimating the flow."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "Designing a Convolutional Neural Network to replace manual force of mitral regurgitation calculation from doppler images"

# DeepCOVID-XR is an deep learning algorithm for detecting COVID-19 on chest X-rays,trained and tested on the largest published clinical dataset in the COVID-19 era with performance similar to the consensus of experienced, cardiothoracic fellowship-trained thoracic radiologists.

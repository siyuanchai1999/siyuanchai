abstract: "DeepCOVID-XR is an artificial intelligence algorithm for detecting COVID-19 on chest X-rays,trainedandtested on the largest published clinical dataset in the COVID-19 era with performance similarto the consensus of experienced, cardiothoracic fellowship-trainedthoracic radiologists. We present DeepCOVID-XR, a deep learning AI algorithm for detecting CXRs suspicious for COVID-19, trained and tested on the largest published clinical dataset from the COVID-19 era to date. "
